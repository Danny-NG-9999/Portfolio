## About Me  

My current work includes **advanced analysis, A/B testing, predictive modeling**, and more.  
I enjoy mentoring and [knowledge sharing](https://example.com).  

I’m currently working in the tech industry, supporting e-commerce and customer success.  
I’m also an ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org/)  
and an organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://www.measurecamp.org/).  

In my spare time, I like solving problems with data, such as building  
[my own recommender model](https://example.com). I also love data discussions  
and sharing those via [podcast](https://example.com).

## Background  

Despite a love of economic and coding from a young age, I originally studied Accounting and Finance  
and worked in Finance before deciding to transition into Analytical and Economic field that's why i decided to pursue MSc Financial Economics in University of Exeter

I later enrolled in a graduate **data science program** while working full-time  
to sharpen my skills and fill knowledge gaps.
