## About Me  

My current work includes **advanced analysis, A/B testing, predictive modeling**, and more.  
I enjoy mentoring and [knowledge sharing](https://example.com).  

I’m currently working in the tech industry, supporting e-commerce and customer success.  
I’m also an ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](https://www.widsconference.org/)  
and an organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://www.measurecamp.org/).  

In my spare time, I like solving problems with data, such as building  
[my own recommender model](https://example.com). I also love data discussions  
and sharing those via [podcast](https://example.com).

## Background  

Despite a love of math and coding from a young age, I originally studied Communication  
and worked in marketing before shifting into analytics. In 2016, I transitioned into  
a **marketing analytics role** — and I’ve loved it ever since.  

I later enrolled in a graduate **data science program** while working full-time  
to sharpen my skills and fill knowledge gaps.
