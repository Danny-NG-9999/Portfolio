## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a data analyst passionate about helping businesses make sense of their data. I enjoy transforming complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights.

My focus is on building dashboards that get used, automating repetitive tasks to free up teams for more interesting problems, and creating models that help businesses plan for the future.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll often find me exploring London’s café scene, attending local events, or enjoying its parks and green spaces. 

I love that moment when data reveals something unexpected — and I’m always keen to connect with others who share an interest in finance, analytics, and using data to make a real-world impact.
